# Valentine's Day - Data Analytics

This repository is to demonstrate basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on anonymouse OKCupid dating profiles.

The entire code with comments for the thought process can be found in the `valentine_data_workshop.ipynb` file. 

There is also a demonstration for building an interactive asymmetrical violinplot based on Plotly which I highly encourage any developer to load up in an iPython environment and play with. It demonstrates how to build useful tools for Analytics Dashboards.
